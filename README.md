# Source code supplementing the ICASSP 2023 paper "Bayesian Methods For Optical Flow Estimation Using a Variational Approximation, With Application to Ultrasound"
The STRAUS.zip file contains 2D data extracted from the [STRAUS dataset](https://team.inria.fr/epione/en/data/straus/) in the MATLAB's .mat format. This includes the B-mode images (with values from -65 to 0 dB) and the ground-truth optical flow (displacement vectors in pixels). You need to download and extract this file before running the `demo.py` and `evaluation.py` scripts.
